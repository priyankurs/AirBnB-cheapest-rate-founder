Get the cheapest rate for selected hotels 



<h1> Provide hotels with there rates for regular customer or rewarded customer and get the cheapest rates among all</h1>


<p> this is a single page program as I haven't added a DB or GUI but rather to get the inputs from command prompt and get instant result 
on command prompt itself<p>

<span> Thi program takes as input type of customer (regular/reward) and the dates for your arrival. This is presently done by putting all
user data in an object and calculating the cheapest rates among all the hotels. </span>

<h3> For Unit Testing I have used Jest </h3>
